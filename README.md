# ALX Front-End: React App Setup (Task 0)

This project documents my first React app setup using Vite as part of the ALX Software Engineering program.

## What I Learned

- How to create and clone a GitHub repository
- How to use the terminal to navigate folders and run commands
- How to scaffold a React app using Vite
- The difference between `npm install` and `npm run dev`
- How to run a local development server at `localhost:5173`
- What JSX is and how it renders in the browser
- How to troubleshoot typos and terminal errors
- That Vite uses Rollup under the hood for fast builds

## Commands I Used

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gracey19/alx-fe-reactjs.git
cd alx-fe-reactjs
npm create vite@latest alx-react-app -- --template react
cd alx-react-app
npm install
npm run dev
