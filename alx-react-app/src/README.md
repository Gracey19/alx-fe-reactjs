# ALX Front-End: Task 1 – Modify JSX in a Pre-built React Component

## What I Did

- Created a new file: `WelcomeMessage.jsx` inside `src/components`
- Wrote a React component using JSX
- Changed the `<h1>` tag to:  
  `"Hello everyone, I am learning React at ALX!"`
- Added a new `<p>` tag with the message:  
  `"I am learning about JSX!"`
- Imported and rendered the component inside `App.jsx`
- Ran the app using `npm run dev` and confirmed the changes at `localhost:5173`

## What I Learned

- JSX is like HTML inside JavaScript — it powers React components
- Components are reusable blocks that return UI
- How to import and use a component inside another
- How to run and test changes live using Vite

## Commands I Used

```bash
cd alx-fe-reactjs/alx-react-app
npm run dev
